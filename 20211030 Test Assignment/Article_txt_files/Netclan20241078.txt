Traffic Signals are inefficient because even if there are no cars or no pedestrians on the road it still works on a timer and stops the traffic or pedestrian unnecessarily.
We provide a Computer vision-logic to Manipulate the traffic signal to work such that it turns red only when x number of pedestrians are waiting to cross the signal.
